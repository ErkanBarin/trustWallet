# Test Strategy for Trust Wallet Android App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Trust Wallet Android application, focusing on the "Create Wallet" flow. It provides a structured approach to ensure comprehensive test coverage across functional, non-functional, and security aspects of the application.

## 2. Scope

### In Scope

- Wallet creation flow (T&C → Seed Phrase → Confirmation → PIN)
- UI/UX validation
- Security validation for sensitive operations
- Performance testing
- Accessibility testing

### Out of Scope

- Backend services testing
- Blockchain integration testing
- Long-term stress testing
- Penetration testing

## 3. Test Approach

### 3.1 Test Levels

| Level               | Description                    | Approach                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Unit Testing        | Testing individual components  | Automated unit tests for utility classes |
| Integration Testing | Testing component interactions | Automated tests for page interactions    |
| System Testing      | End-to-end testing             | Automated UI tests for complete flows    |
| Acceptance Testing  | User acceptance                | Manual validation of critical paths      |

### 3.2 Test Types

| Type          | Description                      | Priority |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | -------- |
| Functional    | Core functionality validation    | High     |
| UI/UX         | Visual and usability testing     | High     |
| Performance   | Response time and resource usage | Medium   |
| Security      | Protection of sensitive data     | High     |
| Accessibility | Usability for all users          | Medium   |
| Compatibility | Device and OS version support    | Medium   |

## 4. Test Prioritization

Tests are prioritized using the following criteria:

- **P0**: Critical path tests that must pass for release
- **P1**: High-impact functionality that should be tested in every build
- **P2**: Important functionality that should be tested in major releases
- **P3**: Edge cases and nice-to-have features

## 5. Test Automation Strategy

### 5.1 Automation Framework

- **Technology**: Java + Appium
- **Design Pattern**: Page Object Model
- **Reporting**: Allure
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins/GitHub Actions

### 5.2 Automation Criteria

- Critical path flows should have 100% automation coverage
- Tests should be independent and atomic
- Tests should be maintainable and readable
- Tests should provide clear failure information

## 6. Test Environment

| Environment | Purpose                | Configuration                |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Development | Early testing          | Latest build, mock data      |
| Staging     | Pre-release validation | Release candidate, test data |
| Production  | Smoke testing          | Production build, real data  |

## 7. Risk Analysis

| Risk                                | Impact | Mitigation                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Seed phrase exposure                | High   | Verify secure handling in memory and clipboard |
| PIN security                        | High   | Verify PIN storage and validation              |
| App crashes during wallet creation  | High   | Extensive testing of edge cases                |
| Poor performance on low-end devices | Medium | Test on representative device range            |

## 8. Test Deliverables

- Test cases (manual and automated)
- Test execution reports
- Defect reports
- Test metrics and coverage reports

## 9. Test Metrics

- Test case pass/fail ratio
- Defect density
- Test coverage percentage
- Automation coverage percentage

## 10. Exit Criteria

- All P0 and P1 tests pass
- No critical or high-severity defects open
- Minimum 90% test coverage for critical paths
- Performance meets defined thresholds
